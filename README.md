# Master's thesis "Connecting green space supply and demand: modeling the walkable environment of European cities"

Spatial modelling of recreational flows from urban inhabitants' homes to their nearest park entries.
Index development and application for detour index (DI) and local significance (LS) indices.

  DI: proxy for the number of detours people have to take (Euclidean distance / Network distance)
  
  LS: Recreational flow from house entry to park entry (Number of people * Park area / Network DistanceÂ²)
  
All analysis was done in a cutoff distance of 10 walking minutes around the house entrance. 
The index calculation was applied for >800 European cities.
The code was moved to https://github.com/blabohm/projects/tree/main/walkability_europe
