\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces The network colors depict the cumulative LS. A higher LS value is depicted by a darker red color, representing i.) more people taking this path, ii.) the people taking this path are living in closer proximity to the green space, and / or iii.) the path is leading to a larger green space. Since the LS values are cumulative, a higher value might also mean more paths from different buildings overlapping (See appendix 3 for further information). The building colors represent average DI calculated for all green spaces in a network distance of 500 meters from a building. The dark blue the color of a building is, the closer to one the DI value, the more direct can its residents travel to the closest green spaces. The opposite is the case if the color tends towards orange.}}{11}{figure.3}%

An increased LS is mapped in red, a decrease in blue. Increasing LS values depict street segments that are higher visited. An increasing DI is mapped in blue, a decrease in red. Higher DI means that the trajectories from a building to the nearest UGS entry have become more efficient. The top two maps show the unlimited access alternative.}}{17}{figure.7}%
